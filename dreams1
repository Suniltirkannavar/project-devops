A dream doesn't become reality through magic;
it takes sweat, determination and hard work. ...
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. ...
All our dreams can come true,
if we have the courage to pursue them. ...
You have to dream before your dreams can come true. ...
Ideologies separate us
